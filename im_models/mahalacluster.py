    Relational anomaly (zero-day) scorer based on the *relative Mahalanobis
    distance* (RMD, Ren et al. 2021) to the known-class Gaussians, replacing
    the previous nearest-centroid inverse-Euclidean score
    (`sigmoid(1 - max_k sim_k)`).

    Why: the old score treated every direction in hidden space as equally
    surprising -- it measured plain Euclidean distance to each class *mean* and
    took the nearest. So a real zero-day that happens to land near a known
    class's mean, but off that class's actual manifold (e.g. displaced along a
    direction in which the class has almost no spread), scored as
    non-anomalous and was missed. Mahalanobis distance whitens by each class's
    own covariance, so "near the mean" stops implying "in-distribution": a
    displacement along a tight direction now costs a lot, along a wide
    direction little. The *relative* variant additionally subtracts a
    class-agnostic background Gaussian, which is what makes it strong in the
    near-OOD regime (a novelty sitting close to a known class).

    Relational bottleneck preserved: the head still sees ONLY the query point's
    relation to the known classes (its Mahalanobis distances to the known
    Gaussians), never absolute coordinates -- we've only upgraded the metric
    from isotropic-Euclidean-to-mean to covariance-aware-to-distribution.

    Parameter-free and self-calibrating: min_k RMD_k is naturally centred at
    zero (negative when the point fits some known class better than the shared
    background, i.e. in-distribution; >= 0 for a novelty), so no learnable
    scale is needed and the RMD=0 decision boundary maps to probability 0.5.
    Being parameter-free also means (a) the AD/BCE loss keeps shaping the
    *encoder's* geometry, backpropagating through the distances exactly as
    before, and (b) an (empty) pretrained confidence-decoder checkpoint still
    loads.

    Covariance is estimated *cluster-wise* (one diagonal covariance per known
    class, from that class's own support residuals) and *diagonal*, with
    shrinkage toward the class's own mean variance and a floor -- diagonal
    keeps each per-class estimate invertible from a handful of support
    points, and the per-class shrinkage/floor keep it stable even when a
    class's support is scarce (down to a single point, whose residual is
    all-zero and so falls back entirely to the floor).

    Output: a per-query anomaly probability in (0, 1), shape [n_query, 1] --
    the same contract the rest of the pipeline expects from this module (the
    `> 0.5` routing threshold and the confidence-strategy readouts all treat
    it as a probability), so it is a drop-in replacement.
